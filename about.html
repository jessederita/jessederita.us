	<!--	<h1>About Jesse</h1> -->
</head>
<body>
	<div id="opening-line">
<p>Jesse is a lot of things.</p>
</div>
<p>He is a coder, a developer, a lover of order.</p>
<p>He is a writer, an aspiring comic, a poet, an innovator and an artist.</p>
<p>He is an INFJ, a pie maker, and a lifelong library loiterer.</p>
<p>As an adult, he fell in love with the internet, because it was basically a portable library.</p>
<p>When he was six, he aspired to be president of the United States, after a field trip to Yale.</p>
<p>He also fell in love because of the internet (thanks, OkCupid!) with a wonderful woman he never would have met otherwise.</p>
<p>He has twelve college credits, a cumulative 4.0, and dreams of someday affording college and having time to go again at the same time. </p>
<p>Likes include maple walnut ice cream, cardigans, WWII documentaries, being outsmarted by his kids, coffee, baked beans from West Side Diner. Yes, he is your dad.</p>
<p>Dislikes include being told he looks like Harry Potter, conversations before 8am, grocery shopping, consumerism culture, and packing any sort of meal into any sort of bag. </p>
<p>He dreams about writing something that is meaningful, changing lives with technology, starring in his own sitcom about nothing, and having a need for a passport.</p>
<p>He believes in simple, responsive design that gives the user the feeling that they got what they came for. He believes in hand coding whenever possible, designing in the browser, and that the way we think about how we design websites is as important as designing them.</p>
<p>He believes all the best design be it for the web or otherwise is simple, stripped down, and doesn't just function, but works for the user especially well.</p>
